## Tech Stack

**Server:** Spring-boot 3, Spring Security, Hibernate, PostgreSQL

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework for building standalone, production-grade applications with minimal configuration. It simplifies setup and deployment, reducing boilerplate code and providing defaults for configurations.

Spring Security is a customizable authentication and access control framework for Java applications. It secures applications against common security threats and integrates seamlessly with other Spring frameworks.

Maven is a build automation tool for Java projects. It simplifies dependency management, testing, and packaging, ensuring consistent builds across environments.

Hibernate is an ORM framework for Java applications. It simplifies database access by mapping Java objects to database tables, improving performance and maintainability.

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system known for its reliability and scalability. It offers advanced features and strong community support, making it a popular choice for backend applications.

These technologies provide a solid foundation for building scalable, secure, and maintainable backend applications.
